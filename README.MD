-GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

-WHEN I click the start button

-WHEN I answer a question

-THEN I am presented with another question

-WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
-THEN time is subtracted from the clock (unable to subtract 
time and this area is still under development)

-WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
